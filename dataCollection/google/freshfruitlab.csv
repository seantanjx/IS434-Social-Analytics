ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDODVpZ0lREAE,Tried messy breakfast. Doesn't provide condiments like jam for the muffins. Butter provided is melted instead of cold frozen butter. Muffin is too oily.  Sausage feels jelak after eating. Having a bad stomach after eating it suffering from acid reflux. Hope that the restaurant gone through food safe certification course. Still unsure if food served is fresh and properly handled.  Scrambled egg tasted weird with a strong herbs taste rather than any other brunch cafes buttery smell. Coffee is quite good.,4 days ago,2020-10-16 11:15:31.912734,1.0,J Toh,1,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112932251412218273564?hl=en-SG

The missus ordered the pork chops which were tasty enough but not as fork tender as we would have liked,being a little on the chewy,slightly tough side.

Extremely generous with the Icelandic caviar and 3 whole scallops. I might be biased, because I love caviar so every bite was a pop of joy in my mouth! The creaminess probably came from all the caviar. The pasta was a tad rich after awhile but not so bad that I couldn‚Äôt finish it.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3MllYZjNBRRAB,"A rather interesting place for Sunday Brunch - they're open from 10am and I like that they serve a sampling of their juices in such cute test-tube samplers.   As the name suggests, Fresh Fruits Lab styles its decor and food presentation like a laboratory, and has all things related to science, right down to their gag toys.  Diners are invited to fool around with the toys while waiting for their meal to be served.  Not long to wait though, as FFL's service is both prompt and efficient.  The food is very well done - truffle fries came crisp and fragrant, and our brunch portions were huge.  The Messy Breakfast is utterly delicious - I love the fresh sausages (as opposed to frozen or canned) which are juicy and not overly processed (into a smooth paste) so you can taste and feel the bits of meat.  The winner though, hands down, are the bacon-wrapped pineapple cores, which are heavenly with the smoky salty flavor from the bacon, coupled with the sweet and slightly sour core of the pineapple, made soft by the cooking process.   Just those bacon-pineapple rolls were enough to make me wish I didn't have to share.   *grin*  Parking on a Sunday, at 11am, is pretty easy.  Loads of space on the road that's just in front of the cafe  (Lorong Marzuki), and best of all, since its Sunday, its FREE PARKING!
