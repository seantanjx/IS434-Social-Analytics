ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDejUzVXB3RRAB,"We chanced upon this restaurant after visiting the Canopy Park on a Monday, and there was a handful of tables occupied but only one service crew taking orders, and serving the food and drinks. Somehow, he still managed to be courteous, and apologetic if need be, remembering all of our orders or requests (and other customer's, too).  We ordered the popular mains - Empress Pasta, Charilicious (if I remember the name correctly), and Lychee Chocolate Cake for our dessert. The food are unique to the taste buds, but we felt that a bit more can be added.  For example, the Empress Pasta (i.e. Cereal Prawn Pasta) feels like the cereal is homemade (not the packaged one), and tastes great especially if mixed together with the pasta. Thus, we felt that there should be more 'cereal' added to make the pasta more tasty. The Charilicious meat is tender but also can be more 'char' and added with more sauce.  Overall, I think this will still be one of the restaurants that you can try if you visit Jewel for its fusion cuisine and great service (but I hope if it's peak period, there won't be only one service crew though üòÇ)",a month ago,2020-10-16 11:05:09.195889,4.0,Melody L,6,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108092266926670488716?hl=en-SG

We ordered all the signature dishes. Almost half of the Charchulicious was too tough and dry to chew. Lamb rendang bao lack spice but lemak enough to eat. Bao was deep fried. Fried carrot cake w truffle mayo was just beyond taste. Thick batter and overly salty turnip cake inside. Otah oglio was safe and tasty. Laksa chiffon cake for dessert were disappointing. No Laksa fragrant. Just dried shrimp taste. Maybe having coconut milk drizzled over would make it better. Ornee (yam) cake was good.
