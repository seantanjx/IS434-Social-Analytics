0,Nice decor but food is average,"This is an insta-worthy cafe with all the lovely decors. It is also family friendly. However, I find that the food is average, to my taste. The cake is not bad though.",3,5f8825f9542b2ed695c607c1
1,Lovely little place with a character,"They really put an effort.
A very extensive menu to suits burger and chips lovers,  health conscious, salad and veggie lovers as well as for fussy little people.  
Presentation of food is fantastic. 
I would just like to have choices for salad dressing.",5,5f8825f9542b2ed695c607c2
2,Good place to go with a furkid,"We had to sit outside as we had a puppy with us but the female staff was friendly, and very helpful in turning on the fans.  

They also give complimentary fruit juices in test tubes, while water is served in lab beakers.

We ordered two...lunch specials, comprising chicken burger and aglio olio pasta with deep fried otah.   The burger was a generous portion, and the fries were good.  Unlike mot other places, the buns did not turn out soggy at all, and I loved the two sliced pickles.  Though deep fried, the chicken was not dry.

 The pasta (you have a choice of penne or spaghetti) looked spicy,  but was not.  I liked the deep fried otah, but the aglio olio sauce with minced otah was a tad bland for me.

The sets came with pumpkin soup, which tasted great.  For $2 more each, you can select an artisan tea.More",3,5f8825fa542b2ed695c607c3
3,Quirky little resto serving up great food that tastes as amazing as it looks,"This is an artsy, cozy, quirky little resto serving amazingly delicious food in- yes, laboratory glasswares! Beakers, test tubes in test tube stands, graduated cylinders and the like. Food was equal parts delicious to the eyes and the appetite, what with generous servings coupled with...meticulous plating that’s definitely instagrammable. They also had a kid’s menu that served up fruits and vegetables playfully, my daughter actually ate all the alfalfa bean sprouts, strawberries and grapes with her koala shaped ham and cheese sandwich!  Had pan-seared salmon that was melt-in the mouth flavorful. Chalkboard walls and microscopes are perfect for the ‘gram. Do check them out 😊More",5,5f8825fa542b2ed695c607c4

6,Nice Hi-tea :),"Came on a Sunday & was glad that it was not crowded. Sat down and was immediately served complimentary fruit juices in test tubes. Brought back memories of secondary school days of using these science apparatus in the lab :)

We ordered the Hi-tea set...& were delighted with the plating, that was just visually amazing to look at. The sweet and savoury food items were yummy, and the free flow artesan tea complimented nicely. Would love to be back to try it’s lunch & dinner menu.More",5,5f8825fa542b2ed695c607c7
7,Nice set lunch,"My friends and I visited the cafe at close to 1pm and it was surprisingly not crowded. I love the decor, with cute cushions and toys, chalk drawing on blackboard. It makes you feel like you're in a laboratory. They served us a set of...complimentary drinks containing fruit and vegetable juices, served in little test tubes. We ordered the tomato based seafood pasta (available in spaghetti or penne) and pan fried fish with grilled vegetables. The mains came with salad of rockets, beet and fruits, which was light and refreshing. The mains were quite delicious too, but nothing to rave about: some fish, 2 shrimp and 3 pieces of fried calamari. The meatballs with cheese were a little disappointing: tasted like microwaved beef balls. Even Swensens served better meatballs. The mushroom soup was so so only. The artisan teas were good, and only cost $2 with the set lunch. We also had the chocolate cake and lychee mousse cake which were outstanding!More",4,5f8825fa542b2ed695c607c8
8,Excellent choice,"Was drawn to this place as the outside seating area is pet friendly. 

Welcomed with complimentary drinks in test tubes... brought back memories of school days in the lab. Fruit flavoured water was served in beakers. 

Menu had a number of healthier choice dishes which...was really great!  Service was friendly and food served faster than expected. 

Soft shell crab spaghetti, fish and chips as well as the Caesar chicken salad were all great. 

The chendol coffee was an interesting choice. It had grass jelly, chendol and strawberry syrup. Hubby had it without the syrup and said it was good. 

Even the rainbow cake to end off the meal was lovely. 

Will definitely be back!More",4,5f8825fa542b2ed695c607c9
9,"Impeccable service, fun theme, and fantastic food!","We came for brunch, soups were fantastic, zucchini cooked perfectly and the messy breakfast was a great portion with fluffy flavorful eggs and beautifully charred tomatoes and veggies. The lab theme is very fun, all drinks served in beakers or erlenmeyer flasks, complementary juice tasting...in test tubes! Their service was incredibly efficient and friendly, our lemon/orange/honeydew flavored water beakers were never empty. To top it off, best standalone espresso I've had in Singapore! I cannot recommend this stop enough!More",5,5f8825fa542b2ed695c607ca
