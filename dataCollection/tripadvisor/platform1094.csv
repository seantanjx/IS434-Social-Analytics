0,Themed restaurant,"This restaurant is quite out of the way if you don't drive. But if you drive, the car park is just 2 mins walk away. The interior of the restaurant is much nicer than its surroundings. Ordered the crab meat aglio olio, caesar's salad, beef...ball pasta with fried enoki and Flaming Brew. The flaming brew is only for Instagram purpose, tastes diluted and bland. The cinnamon is too coarse. Ended the meal with a mango supreme which is sponge cake wrapped in mango mousse. The mousse is nice and light, not too sweet. Prices are reasonable.More",3,5f8825d7542b2ed695c60746
1,Wizardry cute,"Harry Potter’s popularity might be waning but the café is still attracting their die-hard fans. As we’re on a high tea trail, we’re all aboard at Platform 1094. At $55 per person, the high tea set is a magical experience with wand-swirling-exciting visual presentation and...gimmicks such as dry ice smoke wisps. There is a fun concoction of sorts – bubbling frog potion (Ok, it’s green tea) on a lit coaster, the cutest selection of Harry Potter themed sweet treats (so ingenious!) and a savoury spread so delectably presented, it’s true wizardry to resist touching any of the items.More",4,5f8825d7542b2ed695c60747
2,Nice little cafe and restaurant with harry potter twist,"Nice and clean harry potter theme cafe at singapore. Food was okay, not special. It was nice to try to potter - costume and take photos. You can acces here by metro and walk about kilometre from station. Pretty easy to find route.",3,5f8825d7542b2ed695c60748
3,All the little touches make it very special.,"We decided to stop in at Platform 1094 on our last day in Singapore, and I wasn’t expecting too much. But oh wow, what a totally charming little place! Filled with Harry Potter decor, costumes (of course we all dressed up), wands, owls and other...props. The kids (and adults) loved all the drinks that came with the dry ice making them all smoke - felt very special! Meals were all delicious and we all thought they were really well priced (a place like that in Australia would no doubt charge twice as much). Our server (Gerard?) was very attentive, very helpful and patient when we needed to split the bill between the group of 8. Will be recommending to anyone I know travelling this way!More",5,5f8825d7542b2ed695c60749

5,Magic in the heartlands,"Platform 1094 is a Harry Potter themed cafe located at, well, 1094 Serangoon Road. When you first enter, the decor already looks amazing, and it definitely does not disappoint for the Hogwarts fans.

The dishes were created according to the Harry Potter theme as well,...be it Potions (non-alcoholic drinks) or Poisons (alcoholic drinks), or dishes smartly and aptly named after various scenes in the movie. The food was pretty good, especially the Crab Meat Aglio Olio, which was probably the best of its kind I have tasted so far.

There are also cloaks, scarves, ties, wands and glasses for you to dress up in and take your Muggle shot against the different corners in the cafe that are all Instagram-worthy.

Whether you are a Hogwarts fan or not, this cafe definitely creates a magical experience!More",5,5f8825d7542b2ed695c6074b
