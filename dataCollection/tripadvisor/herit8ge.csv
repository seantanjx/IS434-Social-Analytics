0,Interestingly good fusion dinner,"Chanced upon this little diner place, and the food was good to my surprise. They serve fusion cuisine so you get a mix of local delights with an western influence to it. We ordered the otah aglio olio, truffle carrot cake sticks and their signature...chicken wings with chicken rice chilli sauce (I can't exactly remember the names of each dish :p). Would definitely visit again to try other dishes, food was great. Pricing maybe on high side but that was kinda norm in Jewel.More",4,5f8825f7542b2ed695c607be
1,Birthday dinner ,"I was here to celebrate my mumâ€™s birthday. The food tasted great and the portion was good. Particularly liked the ribs and the pasta! It was delicious!!! When I made a booking at Herit8ge, I requested a birthday cake for my mum as well. The...cake was pretty and it caught me by surprise! The atmosphere is great in the evening. Would definitely return if I had to celebrate another occasion. Thanks Herit8ge for your exceptional service!More",5,5f8825f7542b2ed695c607bf
2,"Great place to sit back, relax, and try some interesting fusion foods in Jewel Changi","Located on the top floor of the shopping mall, surrounded by the gorgeous canopy park.  Came here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. Waiting time were short and staffs were friendly and helpful. 

At lunch, we could enjoy the sun and beautiful greenery...but without suffering under the scorching heat; dinner was romantic and very vibrant ambience. Foods and drinks were tasty and unique! A good selection of drinks and cocktails, foods were delicious and interesting! An unique mix between the tradition Singaporean cuisine and Western food. Portion was generous and reasonable priced. Definitely will be back.More",5,5f8825f7542b2ed695c607c0
