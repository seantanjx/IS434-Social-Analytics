review
"Burpple one for one with generous portions and well cooked beef burger with bacon, cheese, egg and fries"
"Pineapple orange and beetroot carrot drinks given complimentary and overall lab concept was cute. Aglio Olio was nice, sauce had a kick but not v spicy, healthy. Was better than the Forest Wrap, which was too vegetable-y"
"Awesome find with Burpple Beyond near my place. We love ordering the big breakfast set as there's everything we like inside! For the 1 for 1 mains, do note that breakfast items are not included but hey who says you can eat fish & chips and pork chops for brunch? 😋"
"📍: Kembangan

Cajun chicken (~SGD19++): Quite a low profile cafe, but it’s actually pretty good! Would say that overall the food is a bit salty, but I guess that’s what makes it tasty 😛 Chicken was tender and the mushroom sauce on it went well with it too. The vibe of the cafe is cute as well (science lab test tubes and beakers as utensils) and the lunch promo is not bad at all. Ate here with the burpple promo but even without burpple, it is definitely worth. 👍

OVERALL: 4/5"
"FFL Signature Fish & Chips, $19⁣⁣
LOOK at this huge serving - a big piece of Fish, large size Fries, fruit salad on the side and a tub of homemade tartar sauce (which buddy spread it on the fish like how he spreads jam on bread). It tastes good, better than average i would say. That tub of sauce made a difference! The fruit salad on the same was refreshing (esp those watermelon cubes that removes the grease).⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Soft-Shell Crab Pasta, $19⁣⁣
That Soft-Shell Crab was deep fried to perfection 💯 It was so freakin' CRISPY!!! Pasta was drenched in a Chilli Crab kinda sauce - it was sweet and just slightly spicy. I liked it!⁣⁣
⁣⁣
💰-saving tip: Use Burpple Beyond like we do. We get 1 for 1 mains in FFL and many other cafes! Our bill was just $24.40 (inclusive of GST & SC) for 2 mains~ Use our link for 30% off your BB membership > https://www.burpple.com/invite/JEAN154"
"Take the whole family out for a delicious meal at this cosy cafe on Changi Road. The FFL Signature Fish & Chips ($19) is a great option for the kids — battered Pacific dory with homemade tartar sauce and a fruit salad. Adults will enjoy the Masago Caviar Pasta ($20) with crispy soft shell crab. The Forest Wrap ($18) is a great vegetarian option that comes filled with zucchini, eggplant, mushroom, tomato and cheese.

"Come by this cosy cafe on Changi Road for innovatively-plated treats. Go for their Lightning Cars ($18) that sees grilled chicken in brown sauce served with sweet potato purée, and fresh fruits. The kids will adore the sweet and fluffy Banana Pancakes ($18) with mixed berries. Vegetarians, go for their Forest Wrap ($18) filled with zucchini, eggplant, mushroom, tomato and cheddar cheese, served with tomato sauce and a side salad with fruit. Wash it down with an Iced Long Black ($6). P.s There's a bouncy castle to burn off all that excess sugar!

"I'm not sure what I was thinking when I chose to order this vegetarian wrap ($18) rather than a more 'typical' main. But this was a quesadilla-esque wrap filled with zucchini, eggplant, mushroom and tomato with cheddar cheese. It was served with an artistic swipe of tomato sauce for that extra zing and a mesclun side salad with fruit. I couldn't help but think of Starbucks' egg white wrap as I was eating it haha. It was really good though, very flavorful with the saltiness and savoriness of the cheese melding well with the tanginess of the ratatoutille-inspired filling. The wrap was just nicely crisped and toasted, not too thick or doughy. Portion sizing was perfect.
Its quite funny because the dish was served on a big metal disc. Interesting presentation. Also they serve a complimentary shot of fruit juice in test tubes and my iced Long Black ($6) is in a beaker. Most unique presentation accompanied by the whimsical, pastel colors of the cafe. I really enjoyed my dining experience here.
8/10"
"Sweet, fluffy and soft! It came with mixed berries, honey sauce, green sauce that kinda looked like kaya and whipped cream. I loved it, though I wish there were more fruits. 😝 Small thing I didn’t like were the alfalfa sprouts.. they made the dish look nice but I don’t think it goes well with pancakes 😅"
"Pleasing presentation!
In the simple looking bread roll: crab claw chunks, prawn & scallop, dressed up using thousand island, generous sprouts.
Side served fruit salad and more thousand island dressing.
Brunch 10am - 3pm ($16)"
"Served in a metal mug, deep fried beer battered button mushrooms.
Crispy outside & juicy inside (careful it’s hot!)
Dipped the arrabiata sauce.
Another best seller!"
"Awesome presentation using purple sweet potato purée, deliberately scattered fresh fruits, also mixed fruits skewer poked into the thick cut of grilled chicken with brown sauce.
Loved the purple sweet potato purée.
One of the best seller!"
"Very cute looking Pancake!
Biting bacon strip.
Inside the pancake was layers of ham.
Blueberry eyes.
Chef recommendation."
"Pleasant mix of pineapple, apple, and orange juice, and it’s very filling! Love how they stay true to the lab theme, serving the fruit juice in the beakers (even water is served in smaller beakers!). Place is also very children-friendly. :)"
Plating was very well done! Highly recommend this dish alongside their aglio olio!
Very interesting cafe that adopt the idea of science lab. Drinks can be served in beakers and test tubes. Sweet Potato Latte ($6) and Blue Flower Latte ($5) are both non-caffeinated drinks.
Cool cafe near Kembangan MRT that serves juices and alcohol in beakers! Bring back good memories of science lab experiments! Lovely place to hang out with your friends if you are in the area!
"Complimentary fruit juice in test tubes, water in beakers... We got the lunch set for 12++, I got the Dory fish which was delicious, my friend had deep fried pork burger which she enjoyed. Great ambience too, with soft toys at every table for that cosy lunch!
Also a kids play area, family friendly!"
This was very light and rich in lychee flavour. There are lychee bits in it too.
This is milk chocolate mousse infused with tropical fruits green tea ($7.50). However the tea taste wasn’t pronounced so it tastes like milk chocolate mousse.
The butterfly pea latte ($6) and sweet potato latte ($7) were smooth in texture but the flavour wasn’t strong enough for both. We would have liked them more if there was a more distinct flavour!
"Heatt place to spend your weekend brunch. Quite interesting that they give you complimentary fruit juices inside a test tube.
The pancakes are fluffy, has banana in the batter instead of being mixed in the batter (do you get it 😅). Served with fruits, cream and maple syrup 4/5"
Interesting place that uses beakers and test tubes for beverages. A family friendly place ideal for couples with toddlers. The fish and chips was of good size and tasted fine.
"Da Bomb Burger - A juicy 250g beef patty with crispy bacon, sunny side-up and melted cheese. It just tasted so good! Loved how the burger came with not only fries, but a generous serving of fruit salad as well. Masago Caviar Pasta - the Pasta came with baked half shell scallop topped with fresh quail egg and caviar masago. This was definitely my favorite dish! The sauce just elevated the pasta to a whole new level. Love the huge scallops as well. FFL wings - The chicken wings had a really good crisp and the hot arrabiata sauce was a perfect complement. The chicken floss gave the chicken a unique twist. P/s: The iced hazelnut chocolate drink tasted really good as well, you might want to give it a try!"
"The menu has been lightly refreshed, with new items such as Lamb Rack, Soft Shell Crab Burger and Italian Asian Chicken Risotto (it's a chicken rice risotto!).
⠀
The Ice Tea series is very DIY - you get to play and experiment with the entire setup at your own table. Who can make the biggest bubble?"
"Afternoon tea set for 2 at $38++, which includes:
Mini Sweets --> apple crumble tart, coffee eclair, pistachio cream puff, fruit tart
Mini Savouries --> minced beef patty burger, salmon asparagus salad, fried prawn bruschetta, mushroom tart
Choice of grapefruit soda or artisan tea (we chose tea)
The portions are really tiny but surprisingly we were pretty full at the end of it, even though we ordered an additional beer-battered shrooms ($10) that we couldn't finish and ended up packing away cos the mushrooms were really humongous!
For the sweet stuff, I found the coffee eclair a little too sweet, and the coffee cream inside tastes more like toffee/caramel. The pistachio cream puff pastry reminded me of kaya even though my friend decided she couldn't taste any hint of pistachio. The fruit tart was essentially a tart shell filled with whipped cream and topped with a couple of blueberries and small wedge of strawberry. Only the apple crumble tart was the most decent to me.
The savouries fared better in my opinion. The beef patty was flavourful even if it's a tad dry, and the bread was nicely buttered. The bruschetta was crisply toasted and crunchy, though prawn was a bit small. Initially I thought the salmon was smoked but actually it seemed like it's seared, so it's not bad. The mushroom tart contained what felt with very thick mushroom soup but I love mushroom soup, and portion size was small enough to not get sick of it."
"[$20]
Pasta was done well, tasty.
Scallops were good.
Cute little quail egg on top.
Generous serving of caviar (?),
Even though i don't fancy having caviar, this dish was pretty good. Pricy for me though.
😋 7/10
💸 6/10"
"Crunchy crispy shoe string fries, sliced juicy beef steak sandwich with fresh cut onion, tomato & sweet sauce and watermelon, pineapple, green leafy salad...
From old menu."
"Masago caviar pasta ($20): happy to see the scallops! A bit too oily thou
Pan oriental pasta ($19): Nice chinese herbal chicken soup and a big chicken drumstick, but it came with pasta in a plate. Well, a bit confusing. Haha
Fruit pancake ($11): Fluffy thick pancake with some berries blended in, topped with apple slices w syrup and berries. Hmm... Normal?"
"Partially lab environment with kidney dish to contain cutlery, test tube and beakers for drinks. Test tube drinks are complementary different type of fruits juice.
Tried iced ($8) and hot ($7) matcha chocolate. Very rich and milky.
Hot yuzu ($6) and happiness tea ($5). Light and refreshing.
Their truffle fries ($12) is good! Freshly prepared, hot, yummy with truffles that is not too strong."
"🙀💕 The chicken 🍗 was superbly juicy and infused with flavours even to the bone, and had an interesting texture topped with the slightly sweet chicken floss. Will definitely order this again! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
"Whether it is the Lunar New Year or not, this bak kwa pizza (S$17.00) is a hit. Pieces of bak kwa are put together with pork floss, wild rocket and pineapple cubes over a mayonnaise base. I'm so happy with it until something set me thinking after the meal: was there cheese on top of the pizza?"
"For S$12.00, this is more than just a piece of otah sandwich. The thick finger of otah is full and spicy enough even for people who don't take chilli, and at the same time enough for one, good for sharing for two. I concur with the chef's recommendation."
"Terrific!One of the best burgers around but i really questioned the purpose of the avocado(overriped and in lumps) in the burger.The fruit salad at the side was refreshing and the chips was a tad bland.Onto the burger,the chicken was well-seasoned,tender and juicy.I really loved the egg as the yolk was not too runny which would really make the burger seem messy.The bun was soft,above average.Great presentation and definitely coming back for more.Overall:8/10
Add-ons:Service was even better than high-class restaurants."
Weekday lunch set. Nice presentation but Batter was too thick and sauce insufficient (not fragrant enough too). The salad (appetiser) was better than the main course.
"Went there last weekend to meet one of my girl friends with my toddler in tow. So glad that they have some photo props to keep my toddler busy (lol). Both of us loved the berry pancakes, though we are usually skeptical about pancakes. The soft and fluffy pancakes get its fruity flavor from the hidden berries in the batter, as well as some fresh fruit topping."
"Probably one of the overrated place to try out their dishes. It's really cool and the plates they used are like what you see when you do chemistry in lab condition. (As you can see, they use a beaker to contain fruit juice) Not very fond of this place but concept is really nice. Location is not favourable if you sit outside as it is right beside a main road and it might be hot too! Nevertheless, went there twice but still rating it 3/5. 5/5 only to the Instagram worthy pictures of the food. Nuffsaid:)"
Love this Chilli soft shell crab pasta! Taste heavenly! My Friend ordered egg Benedict and the poached eggs cooked just nice . Recommended this place for the affordable good food ! The complimentary cold pressed fruit juice is a bonus !
Fairly average food. The bacon wrapped pineapple was an interesting combi. Truffle scrambled eggs was not too bad. Pasta was a tad dry. Nothing particularly 'wow'. Cute lab concept and not too bad service. But not likely to return for the food.
"Fairly decent food for the price paid. I felt that the Masago caviar pasta is one of the better brunch cafe pastas I have eaten so far. Complimentary fruit juice is an added plus and while food isn't tip top, it presents very good value."
"This is the eggs florentine from the classic menu, $14++ (there's gst and service charge) | Poached eggs (runny enough), bacon strips, baby spinach layered onto a piece of English muffin. Ordered an add-on of their smoke salmon ($1.50), by far my most favourite smoke salmon from a cafe 🙌🏻 | P.S. they gave testers of their pressed juice when you first get a table."
Found a cafe that is quite near my Neighbourhood . (Got direct bus number 2) The burger taste so good same goes to the fried mushrooms . The portion is quite huge so don't order too much if you are a small eater . Will definitely head back to FFL again . Not to forget the staffs will give you a tube of fruit juice for you to drink and freshen yourself from the stuffy weather .
"Thick beef patty with sunny side up, will definitely fill your tummy!"
"If you are a scallop lover, should try this pasta. The pasta sauce goes well with the scallop and pasta! Yums"
"I see having brunch as a treasured luxury, so it made me very happy when my brother decided to take me out for brunch today before an afternoon of studying and driving lesson! Adding on to that joy was a reasonably priced brunch fare at a unique scientific-ly themed cafe that takes pride in their fruits garnish and juices. Fresh fruits lab serves some good egg bens and decent pancakes! My brother was all for the egg bens, going on about how he'll definitely come back for more.
For me, the crust edges of the stack of 3 pancakes were delightful, however the incorporation of berries within the batter could have been omitted as it made the middle mushy. Overall worth an order especially when the pancakes were still good on its own without the syrup! Definitely hope to be back to try their other mains!"
"The well-cooked pasta was professionally and evenly lubricated, with the tantalising aroma of oink notably present in the proceedings and (as I asked for extra spicy) a wicked, searing chilli padi heat, so delicious that the prawns admittedly tasted a bit deflated and self-conscious amidst all the aglio olio swag. 4/5
http://secretlifeoffatbacks.com/2015/10/spicy-aglio-olio-with-prawn-fresh-fruits-lab/"
Dined at FFL for a celebration! Generous serving & tasted really good!
"Loved the eggs florentine, their English muffin is so crispy unlike many others. Coffee to me is meh."
"We ordered grilled fish from the set lunch list and Da Bomb Burger - they were really good! Complimentary cold-pressed fruit juice was served and we ended the meal with mint mocha. Totally enjoyed the meal, being fascinated by the decor around us and enjoyed the pop music that was played... it was raining cats and dogs and I felt so bliss being there chatting with Loved One and simply just chilling!"
"Fish & Chips ($19). The concept of this restaurant was really creative, serving ice water in beakers and fruit juices in test tubes! But the food is kinda pricey."
Easily one of the best prepared poached eggs I've had in Singapore. Ooziness level 💯
"Delicately plated with Baked Half Scallops topped with Sunny Quail Egg and Cavier Masago. Spaghetti was cooked to al dente, and wholesomely infused with the taste of Masago Cavier. Half Scallop was well seasoned and baked to perfection; not too hard and chewy but instead light on teeth. The dish is a little heavy on taste some might find, but this dish definitely suits my taste bud, someone who enjoy seafood and prefer food with heavier flavors!"
"Complimentary samples of freshly-squeezed fruit juice were served in test-tubes along with water in beakers. Pasta was good, and so were the strangely addictive mushrooms."
The chocolate cake was perfect and not too jelat. Tea had a unique taste :-)
Fish was a tad salty for me but the chicken was amazing (im sorry I really cannot remember the dish name). The side order of truffle fries was amazing (my love for truffle fries knows no boundaries). Second post coming up.
A place to consider for a chillax brunch or evening. Have not tried their brunch menu before. However dinner menu was so-so only.
"Beautiful rainbow cheesecake, cute lab crockery for your food & drinks, test tube juices and 1-for-1 beers. Definitely worth a visit and I will definitely be back!"
Super cheesy and for $10 you get 6 juicy and well marinated meatballs in baked cheesy marinara sauce! :) a great appetizer for sharing!
250g of beef in a burger! Might as call this a quarter kilo burger! The meat was well cooked and juicy! But the bread was dry.. And the fries were too salty. For $19.90+ it was okay. Big enough to share!
"set lunches at $12++, cool lab-inspired glassware! haven't used pyrex beakers and test tubes since college"
Apple carrot juice! *cold pressed juice*
Rainbow cake as the main spotlight
Interesting place serving drinks with cool apparatus! This place serves fresh fruit juices and offers a pretty extensive menu. There's even steaks done new Ubin seafood style! It's great to see more cafes/ bistros opening up in the east. This place just opened a month ago.
FFL DA BOMB BURGER
Super worth it with the Burpple 1for1 deal!
"Known for his test tubes and beaker Deco apparatuses. We had a complimentary tube each of fruit juice (yellow was pineapple. Red I couldn't really confirm what it was)! Got the chilli crab burger ($19++) and the scallop masago caviar pasta ($20+). Soft shell crab was used so there really want much ""crabmeat"". The chilli crab sauce also made the buns soggy. Plus there was the mushy crab after taste. The fries were typical McDonald cut fries (which I don't really like) with a hint of truffle flavour. Chilli sauce served here is the sweet kind that you get at some fast food which make you question again and again ""is this chilli sauce?""🤣 As for the scallop masago caviar pasta, the sauce was basically the masago caviar. 4 scallops were given with the huge 'innards' part that I didn't really appreciate and know how to eat. (Do note for Burpplebeyond 1 for 1, you won't get to enjoy the weekday dinner set - of which you will get a complimentary soup and ice cream for each mains ordered). But we got to try the mushroom soup as they forgot we were getting the Burpplebeyond deal.. and I quite like the mushroom soup!!! ☺️ #burpple #burpplesg #freshfruitlabsg #freshfruitslab #freshfruitslabsg #chillicrab #scallop #masagocaviar"
Mash could have been more flavourful! $14.
"Other than a long wait time... food was excellent. We had items from the brunch menu and they were all delicious. Only thing I wouldn’t recommend is the truffle fries as it lacked the truffle flavour.
Overall 4/5 and spent slightly over $30 per head."
"The Pasta al fungi which I had had a strong mushroom cream flavour to it. The fried mushrooms added a little extra crunch, but the dish lacked that oomph. The crabmeat pasta fared better. 💫
It’s a little offshoot in location (speaking for a north-ie). Prices here are also slightly high for the mains without the weekday lunch set ($12+). That said, give the sweet potato latte a go. #freshfruitslab #herpenandfork #sgblogger #sgfoodie #8dayseat #burpple #vscofood #openricesg #cafehoppingsg #instafood #instafood_sg #onthetable #stfoodtrending"
"Have non-stop Korean drama ""marathon-ing"" for a quarter of the day.. Sudden craving for food to fill my stomach but there's so limited food at home.. Found this place through random search for food places near my house..
First time trying carrot cream soup, quite flavorful and feel the slightly rough texture of the carrot puree; love the crunchy croutons.. The red colour sauce tasted like red wine sauce, which I think can drizzle into the soup itself though..
Salmon fillet is placed on a bed of mashed carrots in a nicely decorated plate.. The salmon fillet is a little overcooked (a bit hard) but still acceptable.. The salmon fillet is ""on fire"" though, but unable to capture the flame.. The soft-shell crab pasta tasted quite decent.. Thought it would be better with real crab meat inside the sauce as well..
I quite like the tea-infused cake though.. The taste of tea is right on the dot, not too little or too overwhelming; cake inside is not hard or dry.. The mango supreme cake is not too bad as well.. Both cakes are not too sweet.. #fflfreshfruitslab #carrotsoup #salmonsteak #softshellcrabpasta #teainfusedcake #mangosupreme #burpple #dinner #latemealoftheday #caloriesoverload #toolatetoburnoff #jaslynfoodinstagram"

久仰很久的FFL，突然心血來潮就跑完步和朋友去吃～真的不辜負我的期望👍🏻他的三文魚凱撒沙拉和推薦（忘了？）的漢堡🍔真的料實在，滿足的了我的大胃口，而且一坐下去他就招待兩瓶可愛的混合水果汁跟我們Nice🎉
"Kinda regret ordering the Mint one as it tastes kinda toothpaste like, I'm sure the fruit flavored ones will be much better. Nevertheless, it is really soothing for my throat! Time for another 2 hours of nagging social studies content and writing skills. #cravingsatisfied #nomnomsg #openricesg #burpple #ffl #freshfruitlab #drinks #nua #tutor #socialstudies #science"
"I loved the truffle infused scrambled egg as it was perfectly cooked, moist, soft yet springy. The fragrance of the egg was beautifully enhanced by the truffle oil. I was pleasantly surprise by the bacon wrapped pineapple. the sweet-sour pineapple neutralised the grease and saltiness of the bacon, making each bite well-balanced, yet exciting. Other than the above mentioned, I would say that the rest of the breakfast set was rather unexciting. I will be more incline to order the eggs and the bacon wrapped pineapple only (if possible) the next time I am there. #openricesg #nomnomsg #burpple #igfood #foodporn #sgcafe #cafehoppingsg #ilovemyfood #fotd #foodie #foodgasm #nomnom #food #yummy #hungry #dirtyeating

The food tasted pretty normal and nothing out of the ordinary. It was just a little aesthetically better than other foods and cafes because of its unique concept
"Irresistible wings that are fried to perfection. Super crispy on the outside and yet maintains its juiciness inside, topped with chicken floss. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodunion #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #eatoutsg #setheats #igsg #sgfoodtrend #burpple #throwback"
"The Fish and Chips [$19] looks simple but the batter was good and the fish was fried to perfection. But the highlight would definitely be Da Bomb Burger [$19] which is really Da Bomb! The beef patty was well done but still maintained its juiciness. The bacon was also very crispy and juicy, just the way I like it. Both mains came with fries and fruit salad. Love the fruits and greens as the side but can't say the same for the dressing drizzled over it. For small eaters, this hearty burger meal can fill the stomach for ✌️.
