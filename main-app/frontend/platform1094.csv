ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDLVpyTmd3RRAB,Ambience is quite good. Price Quality ratio is a bit under the chart due to the 'boss' of the place that keeps chasing us away because we didnt spend enough. 'We got reservation at 330pm here so are you done?' says the guy at 2pm.  He later charged wrongly (charged 3x) for the bill and only voided one so now suddenly have to settle w the boss for the extra charge again (the boss forgot to charge the other customer and put the charges on us).  He also forbidded us to use the costumes and hats there due to Covid19 ruling which is understandable. Only to see him allowing other kids to wear the robes and hats there 5 min later due to them having a bday party.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvM2JmYy1nRRAB,"There’s nothing good about this place except for the Harry Potter theme. Went here today and brought my girlfriend as a surprise for her birthday as she’s a huge Harry Potter fan. Called them the day before made reservations and even told them to prepare a nice table with some happy birthday stuff and a slice of cake. They told me to come in to choose the slice of cake as they have many on display. Went in and it was crowded and we got a far corner table. And over right at another corner is some happy birthday signs. I was so disappointed! No one was warm and friendly to wish a happy birthday. Food came and it was Nor worth the price but that’s okay as the theme of the cafe was comforting. I went to the display and said hey my slice for my girl what do you have? And there was only like 4 types. And I said um could you prepare up a slice? And he was like ahhhh later ? Then I said hey I called to make reservations for a table for 2? There’s the birthday girl! And I asked is that the table? That’s the best you guys could do? And he went like errr ya with a awkward smile. I mean cmon there was so many tables with the birthday signage up!

There's a reason less than half the tables are occupied during lunch time 😑 Service was lacklustre - we were told to ""sit anywhere"" after being ignored for a good 2 mins but a waitress then asked us if we had a reservation while we were eating our entrees. The salad and asparagus soup were quite nice. Our flaming cocktails were fun at first but the taste of ashes ruined them later. The cocktail also had no alcohol and was overly sweet. The crab pasta was down right terrible. It came out as we were half way through our entrees - way too fast to be cooked fresh. The pasta was overcooked with tiny shreds of crab meat that we had to hunt for and dry smoked salmon. The pasta was unpleasantly oily and had no depth of flavour. Also, don't put ""aglio"" in the name of the pasta if there is no taste of garlic. When I go to a themed restaurant like this, I am looking for an experience and the terrible food and service was a huge let down.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURReFlfemRnEAE,For a Harry potter themed cafe they did not have a good enough deco theme to make me feel like it's a Harry potter cafe.  The cocktail taste like fruit punch tho I have to admit I liked the flame effects.  The chocolate cake is good. THE LYCHEE CAKE WAS THE BEST FRUIT CAKE I ATE.  Service is okay.  Do not order the Spam fries. It's literally fried luncheon meat.,2 years ago,2020-10-16 03:20:43.982324,4.0,MacSwaggin,0,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106435872950362977580?hl=en-SG

The flaming brew was fun for the visual effects, but it really didn't last long enough. Just long enough for a photo or two and maybe a video. Well, you could keep adding cinnamon until you're satisfied with the effects...but too much cinnamon would probably ruin the drink. The Alchemist Concoction reminded me of a moscow mule. Both drinks were really yummy and I couldn't tell that either of them had alcohol in them. Also tried a chocolate and peanut butter cake (one of the round ones in the display fridge), and it was okay. Not too sweet at least, but not enough peanut butter in my opinion. Kind of like a Reese's peanut butter cup, but not as dense or sweet. It was fun that they also had Harry Potter props for you to dress up in. I thought they could have taken the restaurant one notch further in terms of the theming, but it was not bad (just the reindeer chairs seemed a bit out of place). Overall a fun place to check out if you're a HP fan!  Minus a star since the whole place smelled of truffle oil...I don't remember that in Harry Potter ><",3 years ago,2020-10-16 03:21:46.506063,3.0,Audrey L,0,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117831929796749797288?hl=en-SG

And because of that, it frankly doesn't deserve the hate that it has been getting.  While the place doesn't have a lot of items on the menu, the selection that they offered were adequate, from drinks to desserts to mains. The drinks are the main attraction here, with creatively crafted names and mixture. There's also cocktails served, with one that goes on fire. Personal favorite is the butterscotch ale.  Food portion is also incredibly generous for a cafe, and the price is relatively cheaper than cafes out there. Great value for money. To top it all off, the service is also superb and the cafe even provides you with props to take photo.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRdDllanNRRRAB,"Read positive reviews and decided to swing by a Friday evening since we had no plans and were up for adventure.  This review will be lengthy to document an experience that is anything but magical.  1. If the restuarant is full, you are to write down your name and mobile on the waiting list and wait for your turn.  No one told us what to do we just followed what others were doing. 2. During my 1 hour plus wait outside and even at table service, I noticed the 4 - 5 staff were happy just hiding behind the cake counter and chatting amongst themselves. There is plenty you can do on the service floor, like top up our water when they run low or asking if everything was okie (especially when you know your customers have waited for a long time to be seated). 3. After the long wait with our orders placed, we were told many items were sold out. With already a very lean menu, and items off the list it does seem you were unprepared for Friday evening crowds, this is bad supply planning.  It would have been decent to tell your customers in the waiting line if you are expecting to run out of items so they have a choice to continue waiting, head off somewhere else or make a choice on whatever is still available. It's not nice to tell your customers who are tired and hungry from waiting that almost nothing is left on the menu. 4. If this is intended to be themed restaurant, at least make the effort to dress it up like one. Did not look like anything from a Harry Potter book or the movie. A few wooden wands, witches hats and capes does not count as being 'themetic'. 5. Strictly from a non-alcoholic view point - quite a number of items are with alcohol, then maybe you might want to consider expanding your menu to have a wider range to cater for well..non drinkers.  All in all, a huge disappointment. Food was mediocre, service when available was sub-standard and the distance to travel to this place just wasn't worth it.
